# Weight-Estimation

This repository contains a Java program for estimating the weight distribution of an aircraft. The code allows users to input various parameters, such as payload weight, crew weight, power plant weight, engine power, specific fuel consumption (SFC), and density ratio. Based on these inputs, the program calculates the overall weight of the aircraft and approximates the required power.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository].git
   ```

2. Open the code file named `WeightEstimation.java` in a Java IDE or editor of your choice.

3. Compile and run the program.

4. Follow the prompts to enter the required input values for payload weight, crew weight, power plant weight, engine power, and SFC.

5. The program will calculate the overall weight of the aircraft and approximate the required power based on the given inputs.

6. You can continue the weight estimation process by entering updated values for the power plant weight, engine power, and SFC.

7. The program will display the overall weight and power estimates for each iteration.
